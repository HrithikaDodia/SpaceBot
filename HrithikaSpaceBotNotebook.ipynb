Pulsars are rotating neutron star observed to have pulse of radiation at very regular interval that typically range from millisecond to seconds. Pulsars have very strong magnetic field which funnel jet of particle out along the two magnetic poles. These accelerated particle produce very powerful beam of light. Often, the magnetic field is not aligned with the spin axis, so those beam of particle and light are swept around a the star rotates. When the beam cross our line-of-sight, we see a pulse ‚Äì in other words, we see pulsar turn on and off a the beam sweep over Earth.\n",
